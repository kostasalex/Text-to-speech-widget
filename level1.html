						</h2>
						<div class="ContentArea" v-pre>
							<p>On Saturday, September 9th, the Gotham Gal and I arrived at JFK airport after an
								eight-hour flight from Paris. While waiting for our luggage, I got pushed a notification
								in my web3 wallet that there was an NFT drop underway that I could participate in. So I
								clicked on the link, signed the transaction, and nothing happened (or so I thought). So
								I tried again. Again nothing happened. Frustrated, I turned my attention to the luggage,
								retrieved it, got in a car, and headed home. On the way home, I tried again a few times
								to no avail. </p>
							<p>It turns out that each of my failed attempts to mint an NFT was a scam that allowed a
								thief to eventually take 46 of my most valuable NFTs out of my wallet. I did not realize
								any of this until I woke the next morning to a text from a friend saying:</p>
							<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
								<p>did your wallet get compromised? your NFTs from fredwilson.eth were transferred out
									and sold</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>That&#8217;s when I realized that all of the failed minting activities from the night
								before were actually me getting scammed.</p>
							<p>For much of August, I along with a lot of NFT enthusiasts had been participating in
								something called &#8220;Onchain Summer&#8221; which was a rollout of the new Base layer
								two blockchain from Coinbase. Part of Onchain Summer was a daily NFT drop. You simply
								clicked on the link in the message in your web3 inbox and went and minted. It was fun
								and I collected some great NFTs that way.</p>
							<p>The message I was scammed with looked exactly like those Onchain Summer messages but was
								not from the same sender. I should have noticed that but did not. Mistake number one.
							</p>
							<p>The fact that I signed a transaction and nothing happened should have been a sign that
								something was wrong. Normally when you sign a minting transaction, a new NFT shows up in
								your wallet. When it did not, I should have sensed something was wrong. I did not.
								Mistake number two.</p>
							<p>The fact that I was signing transactions in the same wallet where I keep my NFTs is also
								bad practice and I knew it. The best practice is to hold NFTs in a &#8220;vault&#8221;
								wallet where you never sign transactions and to have a separate &#8220;mint&#8221;
								wallet where you hold nothing but do all of your signing. Mistake number three.</p>
							<p>What I was doing by signing those scam transactions was giving the thief access to a
								number of smart contracts that secured multiple NFTs that I owned. So even though I did
								not sign 46 scam transactions, the thief was able to take 46 NFTs.</p>
							<p>Signing transactions is risky business and needs to be done carefully. I knew that but
								did not take the required care on the evening of September 9th.</p>
							<p>This story has a happy ending. With the help of my USV colleague <a
									href="https://twitter.com/uninsightful">Nikhil</a>, I have recovered 38 of the 46
								NFTs that the thief took from me for a fairly modest sum. As I put it to a friend, it
								cost me between weeks and months of my personal ETH staking rewards. It was enough to
								sting and that&#8217;s good. It was a lesson that I learned the hard way and it was
								worth every ETH that it cost me to get them back.</p>
							<p>There are a few NFTs that I am not going to try and get back, but I am still trying to
								buy back these two NFTs that the thief sold to others who are likely unaware that they
								are holding stolen goods:</p>
							<p><a
									href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/304000212">Anticyclone
									#212</a> currently held by <a href="https://opensea.io/NFTinitcom_Accept">this
									wallet</a></p>
							<p><a
									href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/8105">WoW
									#8105</a> currently held by <a
									href="https://opensea.io/0x66a8FCF7798c3A9f1d283e5adBF76E63FaB52451">this wallet</a>
							</p>
							<p>If you recognize those wallets and know who holds those NFTs, I would appreciate an
								introduction so I can offer to buy them back at their cost.</p>
							<p>I do want to thank everyone who sold me back my NFTs (including the thief who we bought
								quite a few from). Many people sold them back to me at their cost when they heard they
								were taken from me. I really appreciate that.</p>

							<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://avc.com/2011/04/360-reviews/">written about this topic
									before</a>. It is an important topic and I want to raise it again.</p>
							<p>Boards often discuss CEO performance without really knowing how things work inside the
								company. And CEOs often have very little visibility to how they are doing and what the
								board thinks about their performance. When you work for one person, your boss, it is
								typical that you will have regular catchups and at least an annual review of your
								performance (ideally more frequent). But when you work for a group, i.e. a Board, things
								can get very &#8220;squishy&#8221; leaving for a lot of guesswork and worse.</p>
							<p>Enter the CEO 360.</p>
							<p>This is a process whereby the CEO is reviewed by their direct reports and by the Board
								members and often a few more people (a few skip levels, some investors who aren&#8217;t
								on the board, etc). It is frequently done annually but it could be done more often if
								the CEO would like that.</p>
							<p>This process can be run by the CEO&#8217;s coach, an outside facilitator, or someone
								else. Our portfolio company Bolster <a
									href="https://bolster.com/leadership-consulting">offers an excellent CEO 360</a> at
								a very reasonable price.</p>
							<p>I am often amazed by what I learn from a CEO 360. I frequently see CEOs who are excellent
								at managing down and run a very solid leadership team but struggle with managing their
								Board. These CEOs are often seen as weak when in fact they are strong. The opposite is
								also true. I have seen CEOs who are excellent at managing up but terrible at leading
								their team and their Boards love them but their team hates them.</p>
							<p>What is even more important for everyone is the insights that come from a CEO 360. Like
								all 360s, they tell the CEO where they are strong and what they need to work on. Armed
								with that information and a supportive Board and others (coach, mentor, CEO support
								group, etc), CEOs can take action to get better at their job. Without this information,
								it is hard to &#8220;level up.&#8221;</p>
							<p>If you are a CEO and don&#8217;t do a CEO 360 annually, you should start doing one. And
								make it a regular occurrence. It will help you do your job better and it will help
								everyone around you too.</p>

						</h2>
						<div class="ContentArea" v-pre>
							<p>For many years, there were three ways to subscribe to AVC:</p>
							<p>1/ Email &#8211; <a href="https://avc.com/subscribe/">Get new posts delivered to your
									inbox</a></p>
							<p>2/ RSS &#8211; <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/avcfeed">Get new posts delivered to
									your RSS reader</a></p>
							<p>3/ X &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/avc">Follow AVC on X</a></p>
							<p>X revoked the API access that I was using to autopost three or four months ago. I have
								not been active on that service for almost a year now and have no interest in dealing
								with it. </p>
							<p>So if you are one of the 25.5k followers on X and want to keep getting alerted when I
								post, I suggest you go with option 1 or option 2 going forward. There is also a new
								third option that I will talk about at the end of this post.</p>
							<p>If you subscribe to AVC via RSS, you are likely using the old Feedburner feed. That has
								become unreliable and I would suggest moving to <a
									href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/avcfeed">the Feedblitz feed</a> which also powers
								the AVC email delivery. </p>
							<p>I finally moved the email delivery off the old Feedburner feed this week when <a
									href="https://avc.com/2023/08/yubikey-authenticator/">last week&#8217;s post</a> did
								not go out via email. I suspect most of you missed it as a result.</p>
							<p>All of this is a perfect example of the fragility of relying on centralized services like
								X and Feedburner (owned by Google). USV was an early investor in both services and I was
								a big user of them. </p>
							<p>But all things come to an end in the world of centralized services and the challenges of
								getting AVC delivered to the ~100,000 subscribers reminded me of that last week.</p>
							<p>There is a world where services just keep running because they are open source and
								decentralized. I<a href="https://avc.com/2023/06/software-that-you-cant-shut-down/">
									wrote about that back in June</a> and I am excited about that world to emerge.</p>
							<p><a href="https://avc.mirror.xyz/">AVC is available in the decentralized world</a> and you
								can subscribe there if you&#8217;d like.</p>
							<p>So now there are three ways to subscribe to AVC:</p>
							<p>1/ Email &#8211; <a href="https://avc.com/subscribe/">Get new posts delivered to your
									inbox</a></p>
							<p>2/ RSS &#8211; <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/avcfeed">Get new posts delivered to
									your RSS reader</a></p>
							<p>3/ Web3 &#8211; <a href="https://avc.mirror.xyz/">Subscribe to AVC on Mirror</a></p>
							<p>If you are using the email delivery method, you are all good. If you are using the old
								RSS feed or X, I would suggest moving to something else. Or you could just stop getting
								AVC if that suits you. Many of you already have thanks to X and Google (and me).</p>

							<p>I got a new Pixel 7 last week and have started the tedious process of moving over to a
								new phone. </p>
							<p>One of the more painful chores in moving from one phone to another is moving the Google
								Authenticator app and all of the two factor codes to the new phone.</p>
							<p>My partner Nick told me about Yubikey Authenticator and I converted to it while moving
								phones since I was going to have to get all new codes anyway.</p>
							<p>If you use a Yubikey for anything else, switching to Yubikey Authenticator is a breeze.
							</p>
							<p>You download the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/">Yubikey
									Authenticator app</a> onto your phone, insert your Yubikey and start scanning QR
								codes (just like Google Authenticator).</p>
							<p>Then any time you need a code, you simply insert your Yubikey into your phone and your
								codes appear in the app.</p>
							<p>You can also put the Yubikey Authenticator app on a laptop or a desktop and get the codes
								that way which is a great backup solution in case you misplace or lose your phone.</p>
							<p>And, when it is time to switch phones, you simply put the Yubikey Authenticator app on
								your new phone and insert the Yubikey and your codes are there.</p>
							<p>Even with all of this goodness, I still keep physical copies of my backup codes in a
								safe. I am also considering setting up a second Yubikey for the two factor codes I use
								the most just in case I lose my main one.</p>
							<p>When it comes to two factor codes, I think you have to have a plan B and a plan C.</p>
							<p>If you use a Yubikey already, consider using the Yubikey Authenticator for your two
								factor codes.</p>

							<p>USV has been an investor in <a href="https://www.helium.foundation/">the Helium
									network</a> since 2019. I have always loved the idea of using web3 technologies to
								let consumers to &#8220;peer produce&#8221; a communications network creating <a
									href="https://avc.com/2019/06/helium/">a people-powered network</a>. </p>
							<p>Helium started out powering communications between low-power &#8220;Internet of Things
								(IOT)&#8221; devices but with <a
									href="https://blog.hellohelium.com/helium-mobile-beta-is-here/">the introduction of
									Helium Mobile back in May</a>, they are now powering a cell phone network.</p>
							<p>My friend Stephen started using Helium Mobile last month and so I decided to join him. I
								<a href="https://hellohelium.com/">signed up for Helium Mobile</a> yesterday ($25/month
								but free during the beta period) and added it as a second SIM on my phone.</p>

							<p>For now, I am going to use Helium Mobile alongside my primary carrier, T-Mobile, but I do

							<p>Helium Mobile offers members the opportunity to earn <a

							<p>I&#8217;ve written about this topic a bunch over the years. It is something I&#8217;ve
								been interested in for quite a while.</p>
							<p>Our homes are filled with big hunks of plastic hanging on the wall that are off most of
								the time. They look like this:</p>
							<div class="wp-block-image">
								<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async"

							<p>Now that&#8217;s a lovely scene. Some nice plants. A cool wood cabinet. A nice lamp. A
								few books. And a piece of black plastic.</p>
							<p>Here&#8217;s what our family room looks like when we are not watching the TV:</p>
							<div class="wp-block-image">
								<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1323"

							<p>That&#8217;s a Sony TV with nothing special in it. I have done some work to make the art
								run on it, but that work is getting easier and easier. I&#8217;ve been playing around
								with this stuff for almost a decade and I feel like we are about to get to a place where
								everyone can do this.</p>
							<p>Here&#8217;s what is involved.</p>
							<p>1/ It is now simple to collect digital art that you can show on your TV. Here is <a
									href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x0a1bbd57033f57e7b6743621b79fcb9eb2ce3676/57000128">the
									NFT</a> that is showing on that photo. I minted it five days ago for about $90. It
								is part of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/epiphanies-by-jimena-buena-vida">a
									series of NFTs</a>, but mine is unique. There is not another one that looks exactly
								like this one. There are hundreds of places you can mint NFTs these days and new NFT
								mints are offered every day, possibly every hour.</p>
							<p>2/ It is relatively easy to write software to show NFTs on a TV. My partner Nick <a
									href="https://avc.com/2022/10/nft-screens/">did that for the TVs at USV last
									year</a>. We run that software on an inexpensive device called a Yodeck. I am
								currently using software written by the <a href="https://www.brightmoments.io/">Bright
									Moments DAO</a> for their NFT events and that runs on a Mac Mini. </p>
							<p>3/ I expect a number of companies and projects will write consumer-grade software to do
								this over the next few years and I also expect the big consumer electronics companies to
								start shipping smart TVs with this kind of software in them.</p>
							<p>Here is how I see this market working.</p>
							<p>1/ You buy a smart TV with an NFT app in it.</p>
							<p>2/ You connect it to the address that holds your NFTs. For me that is fredwilson.eth. You
								can see my collection <a href="https://opensea.io/fredwilson.eth">here</a>.</p>
							<p>3/ You create playlists like you create playlists on your favorite music app.</p>
							<p>4/ You tell the TV to play those playlists when the TV is off.</p>
							<p>All of the pieces are in place for this to happen. We just need the software to be
								written and the consumer electronics companies to adopt it. That feels inevitable to me.

							<p>The New York Times had a piece yesterday suggesting that tech will no longer be a growth
								engine for NYC and the surrounding metro area as it has been for the last twenty years.
								I am not going to link to the piece because it is behind a paywall but if you want to
								read it, you can google &#8220;Tech Firms Once Powered New York’s Economy. Now They’re
								Scaling Back.&#8221; I talked to one of the reporters who worked on the piece and told
								him that their angle was incorrect. But when a publication has their mind made up on the
								angle, there isn&#8217;t much you can do to convince them otherwise.</p>
							<p>If you take a real estate angle, which is how the New York Times approached the story, it
								is true that technology companies, large and small, are cutting back on their space
								needs. But that is more a reflection of the era of remote/hybrid workforces than
								anything else.</p>
							<p>Here is what I told the reporter working on the story:</p>
							<p>1/ Office leases to tech companies are down. The tech sector has embraced remote and
								hybrid workforces and their office space needs reflect that.</p>
							<p>2/ Rank and file tech workers in NYC are roughly flat as many workers have left the NYC
								metro area but just as many have come here from other locations.</p>
							<p>3/ Top talent in tech has massively increased in NYC since the pandemic as people with
								in-demand skills can now work anywhere and don&#8217;t have to be in the Bay Area
								anymore. There are significantly more USV portfolio company leaders in NYC today than
								there were before the pandemic.</p>
							<p>I saw a headline the other day that said that more than half of the top 50 AI companies
								are in the Bay Area and another 10% are in NYC and nowhere else has a significant number
								of them. So in many ways, not much has changed with respect to the centers of gravity of
								the technology sectors.</p>
							<p>Technology is the growth sector of this century and new sectors like AI, renewable
								energy, web3, etc will power the economies of many regions around the world. NYC will be
								a significant beneficiary of this, as it has been for the last twenty years.</p>
							<p>The idea that the tech sector will not be a growth engine for NYC anymore is laughable.
								But that won&#8217;t stop people from suggesting otherwise.</p>

							<p>The venture capital sector has been in a sustained downturn for almost eighteen months.
								How does this downturn end? Well, it may have already ended, but let&#8217;s see about
								that. We will know for sure in a few quarters.</p>
							<p>The NASDAQ peaked at roughly 16,000 in November 2021. By June 2022, it was down 33%. It
								stayed down for all of 2022 and ended the year at roughly 10,500.</p>

							<p>What is driving this? If I had to pick one thing, I would say inflation and interest
								rates. Yeah, those are two things but they are tied together in times like this. As I
								laid out in the prior versions of How This Ends (<a
									href="https://avc.com/2021/02/how-this-ends/">here</a> and <a
									href="https://avc.com/2022/05/how-this-ends-2/">here)</a>, I believe post-pandemic
								inflation forced the Fed to raise rates aggressively, blowing a huge hole in the asset
								bubble that built up during the pandemic.</p>
							<p>Last week we got some great news. <a
									href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-modestly-june-core-inflation-slowing-2023-07-12/">Inflation
									is way down in the US</a>. That means rates may have peaked and will stabilize or
								possibly come down. I don&#8217;t know if the Fed makes any more moves or not. But I am
								not sure that really matters. What matters most to markets is expectations and I think
								inflation and interest rate expectations have settled down.</p>
							<p>Private capital markets, like venture capital, lag public markets by a few quarters. That
								is because it takes time for private market investors to react to the public markets.
								The NASDAQ peaked in Nov 2021, but VC markets did not really start slowing down until
								the second quarter of 2022.</p>
							<p>Now that the NASDAQ has posted a couple of strong quarters, I would expect venture
								capital to respond. But it won&#8217;t happen overnight. We are in the summer doldrums.
								It takes time for VCs to raise new funds. And deals take months to come together. </p>
							<p>So my guess is we are mostly through this downturn. We will know for sure in a couple of
								quarters.</p>

							<p>My dad and brother used to work in that grey stone building called Mahan Hall.</p>
							<p>And the same storms that did this to West Point did worse to many parts of New England,
								particularly Vermont.</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/01/usv-climate-fund/">USV&#8217;s climate
									thesis</a> is to invest in companies and projects that provide mitigation for or
								adaptation to the climate crisis. Adaptation means accepting that we&#8217;ve made the
								climate worse and adapting to it.</p>
							<p>Flooding is a great example of that. As the earth warms, storms are capable of carrying a
								lot more water and dumping it quickly. West Point took ten inches of rain in a few
								hours.</p>
							<p>USV has made investments in two companies working on flood adaptation; <a
									href="https://www.floodmapp.com/">Floodmapp</a> and an unannounced investment in a
								company helping communities become flood resilient. Flooding will be more common and we
								are going to need better tools to mitigate and manage it.</p>
							<p>Along those lines, <a href="https://partnershipfundnyc.org/">NYC&#8217;s Partnership
									Fund</a> recently announced a new accelerator program focused on water. Their
								partner on this accelerator is the NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
								which manages NYC’s water and wastewater treatment operations.</p>
							<p>This accelerator is called the <a href="https://envirotechlab.nyc/">Environmental Tech
									Lab</a> and they are looking for early and growth-stage companies that have products
								that could be used by the NYC Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
							<p>If you are building such a company and want to apply, you can do <a
									href="https://envirotechlab.nyc/#challenges">that here.</a></p>
							<p>Flood and water management will be critical in adapting to the climate crisis and,
								unfortunately, is going to be a big business.</p>

							<p>The thing that Twitter has been missing since it killed off its ecosystem over a decade
								ago is competition. And as we all know, lack of competition is a very bad thing. In
								governments and in products.</p>
							<p>Competition keeps you honest. Competition makes you hustle. Competition forces you to
								innovate. Competition makes you better.</p>
							<p>So I am thrilled to see some real competition emerge for Twitter.</p>
							<p>I am also excited to see a scaled social media platform embrace an open protocol. In the
								case of Threads, that protocol is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">Activity
									Pub</a>.</p>
							<p>As far as I can tell, Threads does not yet support ActivityPub but has committed to doing
								so.</p>
							<p>I have not enjoyed using any social media apps built on the ActivityPub protocol, most
								notably Mastodon, but I am not sure if that is the fault of the protocol or
								Mastodon&#8217;s implementation. Hopefully, we will see a better implementation with
								Threads. </p>
							<p>But more importantly, protocols that are widely used bring lots of developers to them and
								those developers bring lots of different ideas and products.</p>
							<p>So to me, Threads is about two really important things:</p>
							<p>1/ Competition for Twitter. Long overdue and badly needed.</p>
							<p>2/ The emergence of a widely supported social media protocol. Which should produce a
								vibrant and interoperable social media ecosystem.</p>
							<p>I&#8217;ve got some questions in my mind about how all of this will work. </p>
							<p>What will identity look like in this &#8220;vibrant and interoperable social media
								ecosystem?&#8221; It can&#8217;t be and hopefully won&#8217;t be my Instagram handle.
								Ideally, it would look something like <a href="https://app.ens.domains/">ENS</a> where
								each and every one of us will own and control our own identity/handle, like we can own
								and control a domain name.</p>
							<p>Will there be one protocol for all of social media (short form text, long form text,
								audio, video, etc)? Will Instagram support ActivityPub too, for example?</p>
							<p>What role will web3 play in all of this or will web3 social emerge on a different
								dimension entirely?</p>
							<p>The ability to even ask those questions and ponder the answers is a gift to me and to the
								world. And so, therefore, is Threads. </p>
